# Organic Markdown

The most natural (and delicious!!) way to program.

# Installation

To install organic mardown, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- pandoc must be latest (<= 3.1.12)
- python3
- python3-pytest
- python3-pypandoc

Then run the following to get the latest code:

```bash
https://github.com/adam-ard/organic-markdown.git
```

in the `organic-markdown` directory, run:

```bash
ln -s omd.py omd
```

so that you can run organic markdown `omd` without the .py
extention. Finally, add the organic-markdown directory to your path.
